    <h>Medical nutrition therapy</h>
<P>Medical nutrition therapy (MNT) is the use of specific nutrition services to treat an illness, injury, or condition.[3] It was introduced in 1994 by the American Dietetic Association to better articulate the nutrition therapy process. It involves the assessment of the nutritional status of the client and the actual treatment, which includes nutrition therapy, counseling, 
</P>
<P>and the use of specialized nutrition supplements,[3][4] devised and monitored by a medical doctor physician or registered dietitian nutritionist (RDN).[5] Registered dietitians started using MNT as a dietary intervention for preventing or treating other health conditions that are caused by or made worse by unhealthy eating habits.[6]
